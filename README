How it came about.
***********************************************************************

For many reasons, I always wanted to make one of these.
I remember struggling over stupid issues a few months 
back when I tried making this for the first time.
And the funny part is that that code was three times bigger and wierder.
I gave up on it after a long time because it kept throwing
a NullPointerException whenever it paused for input.

Can come very handy . 
Can easily be customized to make stuff like
Automated Bots, chat clients etc

Whats more?
***********************************************************************

Pretty simple to edit and run
Figure out which parts need to customized and write and read
to/from the socket taking advantage of conditions and blah blah

Instead of the old fashoined command line host/port,
JTel prompts you on-screen for it.

************************************************************************

So What is JTel?

Telnet in Java .
Simple as that .
